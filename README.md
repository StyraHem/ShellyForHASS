Please support us by joining on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/shelly4hass), donate to [Paypal pool](https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8n6AbR9sNk) or buying us [some cups of coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/styrahem).

## Intro
This platform adds components for Shelly smart home devices to Home Assistant. There is no configuration needed, it will find all devices on your LAN and add them to Home Assistant. All communication with Shelly devices is local. You can use this plugin and continue to use Shelly Cloud, MQTT and Shelly app in your mobile if you want. A proxy can also be used to include Shellies on different LAN's.

If you have any problems please see the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/StyraHem/ShellyForHASS/blob/master/troubleshooting.md)

## Features

- Automatically discover all Shelly devices
- Monitor status (state, temperature, humidity, power, rssi, ip, fw, battery, uptime etc.)
- Control (turn on/off, dim, color, effects, up/down etc.)
- Sensors for most of the attributes
- Switch sensors to show status of switch button (0.0.16)
- Detection of click and multiple quick clicks by events
- Works with Shelly default settings, no extra configuration
- Runs locally, you don't have to add the device to Shelly Cloud
- Coexists with Shelly Cloud so you can continue to use Shelly Cloud and Shelly apps
- Using CoAP and REST for communication (not MQTT)
- Working with both static or dynamic ip addresses on your devices
- Using events so very fast response (no polling)

## Installation

### Install with HACS (recomended)

Do you you have [HACS](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/custom-component-hacs) installed? Just search for Shelly and install it direct from HACS. HACS will keep track of updates and you can easly upgrade Shelly to latest version.

### Install manually

1. Install this platform by creating a `custom_components` folder in the same folder as your configuration.yaml, if it doesn't already exist.
2. Create another folder `shelly` in the `custom_components` folder. Copy all files from custom_components into the `shelly` folder. Do not copy files from master branch, download latest release (.zip) from [here](https://github.com/StyraHem/ShellyForHASS/releases).

## Setup

You can setup this component by using HA integration or config.yaml. Most of settings is available from integration but things like decimals, device specific configuration is only available when using config.yaml.

If you have the configuration in config.yaml you can convert it to internal setting by clicking the settings gear for the integration and follow the instructions. If you use advanced settings they will be lost. After conversion the settings in config.yaml will be ignored. To go back to config.yaml just delete the integration and restart HA.

### HA Integration

When you have installed Shelly you can add it in GUI under HA integration. Use the plus button and search for Shelly. You need to specify the prefix that is used as first part of the entity_id to avoid conflicts. Default is shelly.

When you have added Shelly to HA you can do the configuration by clicking the settings gear for this integration.

### Configure in config.yaml

When you have installed shelly and make sure it exists under `custom_components` folder it is time to configure it in Home Assistant.

It is very easy, just add `shelly:` to your `configuration.yaml`

#### Examples

##### Default with discovery and power sensors

```yaml
shelly:
```

##### Get device name from Shelly Cloud

```yaml
shelly:
  cloud_auth_key: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  cloud_server: "shelly-XXXXX.shelly.cloud"
```
You will get the information for the keys above from [Shelly Cloud, User settings](https://my.shelly.cloud/#user_settings) and click GET KEY.

##### Without discovery - manually specify devices

```yaml
shelly:
  discovery: false
  version: true #add version sensor
  sensors:
    - all
  devices:      #devices to be added
    - id: "420FC7"
    - id: "13498B-1"   #Shelly 2, Id + Channel number
    - id: "7BD5F3"
      name: My cool plug   #set friendly name
      sensors: #overide global (all)
         - power
         - device_temp
```

##### With discovery - adjust some devices

```yaml
shelly:
  discovery: true  #add all devices (default)
  sensors: #sensors to show, can be override on each device
    - rssi
    - uptime
  devices:  #configure devices
    - id: "420FC7"
      light_switch: true  #add this switch as a light
      sensors: [ switch ] #Override the global sensor
    - id: "7BD5F3"
      name: My cool plug #set friendly name
```

##### Sensor, global and per device

```yaml
shelly:
  discovery: true  #add all devices (default)
  sensors:
    - all #show all sensors
  devices:  #configure devices
    - id: "420FC7"
      light_switch: true  #add this switch as a light
    - id: "7BD5F3"
      name: My cool plug #set friendly name
```
##### Discovery by ip

```yaml
shelly:
  discover_by_ip:
    - '192.168.5.44'
    - '192.168.32.11'
```

##### Events

```yaml

If you disable discovery only Shellies under devices will be added.

You can only specify one username and password for restrict login. If you enter username and password, access to devices without restrict login will continue to work. Different logins to different devices will be added later.

### Events
[Events added in release 0.0.16]
#### shelly_switch_click
When the switch sensor is enabled an event will be sent for multiple clicks on the switch button. This can be used to trig automations for double clicks etc.

```json
{
    "event_type": "shelly_switch_click",
    "data": {
        "entity_id": "sensor.shelly_shsw_1_xxxxxx_switch",
        "click_cnt": 4,
        "state": true
}
```
| Parameter | Description                                                                                 |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| click_cnt | Number of clicks, 2 = turn back and forth quickly, 4 = double click on momentary switch.    |
| state     | Current state of the switch, can be uset to distinct on-off-on from off-on-off for example. |

### Restart Home Assistant

Now you should restart Home Assistant to load shelly. Some times you need to restart twice to get the required library pyShelly installed. You can see this error in the log file.

Shelly will discover all devices on your LAN and show them as light, switch, sensor and cover in Home Assistant.

### Proxy for VLAN or different network
If you're running Shellies on a different VLAN or network there is a [proxy.py](https://github.com/StyraHem/ShellyForHASS/blob/master/util/proxy.py) that can be used to forward CoAP messages to ShellyForHASS plugin.

Update the script with the ip-address of your HASS installation and run it on a computer/router etc that are connected to same network as your Shellies. Firewall and routing must be enabled, TCP 80 HASS -> Shelly and UDP 5683 Shelly -> HASS. If you're using multiple network interfaces, try routing the multicast packets to the right interface (i.e. `ip route add 224.0.1.187/32 dev eth1`).

## Auto entities (before Monster card)
You can use the component with [auto entities](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities) to filter data in a nice way.

### All shelly devices
```yaml
card:
  show_header_toggle: false
  title: Shelly
  type: entities
filter:
  exclude:
    - entity_id: '*rssi*'
    - entity_id: '*uptime*'
    - entity_id: '*firmware*'
  include:
    - entity_id: '*shelly*'
type: 'custom:auto-entities'
```

### Need firmware update (click on the switch to update)
```yaml
card:
  show_header_toggle: false
  title: Shelly need update
  type: entities
